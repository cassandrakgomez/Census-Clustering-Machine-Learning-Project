# Census-Clustering-Machine-Learning-Project 

Welcome to the Census Clustering Machine Learning Project! This project is designed to provide insightful demographic groupings based on individuals' income, age, and educational background using advanced clustering techniques.

**Project Overview**:
The goal of this project is to analyze census data and uncover meaningful patterns in demographics by grouping individuals into clusters. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of how different factors like income, age, and education contribute to demographic segmentation.

**Key Components**
- Data Analysis: Analyze and preprocess census data to prepare it for clustering.
- Clustering Model: Implement a clustering model to segment the population into meaningful groups.
- Visualization: Utilize visualization techniques to present the results and insights clearly.

**Tools and Libraries**
- NumPy: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
- Matplotlib: To create visualizations and graphs for better understanding of data distributions and clustering results.
- Keras: To build and train a neural network-based clustering model.
- Jupyter Notebooks: To document and interactively develop the project, making it easier to visualize intermediate results and experiments.

**How It Works**
- Data Collection and Preparation: The project begins by collecting census data and performing necessary preprocessing tasks, such as normalization and cleaning.

- Clustering Model Development: Using Keras, we build a neural network model designed for clustering. This model groups individuals based on their similarities in income, age, and educational background.

- Visualization: Matplotlib is used to create visual representations of the clusters. This helps in understanding the distribution of different demographic groups and their characteristics.

- Insights and Analysis: Analyze the clusters to extract meaningful insights about the demographic patterns and trends within the census data.
